LFLC's Restaurant Recommendations 

This project offers you restaurant recommendations and offers you a 10% discount if you find the secret word.

We missed </form> on HTML which helped solve the href issue.
We wanted to bring the submit button & the text to the center but this wasn't working in CSS so put this in HTML.
Adding in <br> to separate the lines. 

Great working as a team as everyone brought in different ideas/aspects to the coding. All have our own strengths which we put together.
If we had more time we would add in music, more detailed information about restaurant locations/recommendations. Have a drop down list of the restaurant recommendations which then would show a map & reviews.
